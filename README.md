# Metagrid
A quick and dirty project that scrapes dota2protracker.com and adds it in-game as a hero grid.

Feel free to contribute in any way you want.

## Setup
1. Install Python >= 3.8
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Rename `config_template.ini` to `config.ini` and setup the path to  `hero_grid_config.json` (it should be inside the dota2 installation folder)
4. Run `python main.py`
